# Predicting Weight from Height Using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project leverages a dataset containing height and weight measurements to predict weight from height using a linear regression model. It covers data loading, cleaning, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## 🎯 Objective
- Develop a predictive model that estimates weight based on height.
- Understand the linear relationship between height and weight through regression analysis.

## 📂 Data Processing Steps
1. **Data Loading:** Imported the dataset from `HeightWeightData.csv`.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values and ensured data consistency.
3. **Exploratory Analysis:** Visualized the relationship between height and weight to identify trends.
4. **Model Training:** Built a linear regression model using the cleaned data.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared and RMSE.

## 📈 Key Insights
- A strong linear correlation exists between height and weight.
- The linear regression model is effective for predicting weight based on height.
